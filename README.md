# problem-solving

All the python script i shared is one of my simple problem solving during i work from my previous company. I more focus in image processing during i involve with image detection project.

**0kb_solution.py**
Detect the images 0kb size and replace it with blank white image.

**data_augmentation.py**
Detect first all the folder in images folder and detect all the images in each folder and randomly duplicate it with different technique. This way make easy duplicate all the images if we have several classes/object in train or test folder in one click.

List duplicate of technique:
- random rotation
- random noise
- horizontal flip

**image size detail**
Identify the image size using OpenCV-Python and Pillow library
